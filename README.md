**generative artwork experiments**

This is a series of generative code experiments, made with the Processing.js library. This is mostly an exploration of recursive iteration and randomness, and change over time.  

Processingjs runs a virtual runtime machine that transpiles Java to javascript. I've written a number of .pde files to that end.

A few of these peices are posted here:
